Here is a copy of the email sent to the recruiter. Please see the email for the demo attachments.

# Intro

Below are some notes on the technical assignment. 

In summary, I’ve fully completed Front-end UI assignment part 1, and partially completed the others to different extents. Please see this email attachment for demos.

# Docker Assignment
The multi-container docker network works. See the attached demo for `docker-compose build`, `docker-compose up`, and then a ping from one container to the other. 

Each container has the required packages. Code exists to mount with sshfs, but is not fully implemented, and pymatgen is installed but the update code is not implemented.

# MongoDB Assignment
I’ve written the code but ran out of time to test.

# Front-end UI assignment (part 1)
I’ve implemented everything and have attached a demo showing the progress bar in the UI

# Front-end UI assignment (part 2)
I’ve attached mockups for three pages developed in Figma.

# Hardware Engineering assignment
This is untested: if I wanted to test it in lieu of the hardware I could probably find a hardware emulator online.
A short response is attached
This is implemented at a high level but the functions to pull files from Windows and Linux are stubbed.

# End
The assignment was a significant amount of work, and I put in a significant amount of time over the weekend. Unfortunately, I had an obligation in South Carolina this weekend planned months in advance. This work doesn’t represent my best work, but hopefully sufficiently demonstrates my knowledge and interest in your team.

Please let me know if there are any additional questions. 

Best,
Adam
