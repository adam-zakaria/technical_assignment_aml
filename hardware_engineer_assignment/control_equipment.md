# Question
Often, a piece of equipment will come with closed-source Windows-based software and can only controlled using this software. Outline two (or more) ways to control this equipment from the central computer.

Run Windows in VirtualBox or run the program in WINE. If you mean that Windows is physically loaded onto the equipment then perhaps RDP would be possible, or some kind of API.
